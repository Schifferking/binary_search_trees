# binary_search_trees

In this project, the objective is to implement a binary search tree (BST). This BST will be created using two classes, one for the nodes and another that contains the tree, and this class will have many methods that perform basic operations of a BST.

To ease the implementation of the BST, the arrays passed must be sorted and don't contain duplicate values.
